### Overview
Now that we have mastered many of the technical skills necessary to design and build websites, it is time to put them into use in a real-world scenario.  In this project, you will find and work with a real-life client to build a website according to **_the client’s_** requests and requirements.  As a result, you will lose a lot of the control you have previously had over design and content choices.  However, you will learn to work with someone who does not have your expertise to develop a site that meets their needs.

_You may work with a single partner on this project if you choose._

### Details

#### Design Requirements
The specific details of your project will be dictated by your client.  It will be **_your responsibility_** to identify a client who is willing to work with you and set up an initial meeting with your client to discuss what he or she is looking for.  You will also be required to stay in communication with your client throughout the project, and to document the communication that takes place.  This will be important to make sure you are conforming to the client’s requests, and not your own.  In addition, since your client will likely not have any knowledge of HTML, CSS, or other web technologies, you will be required to provide clear documentation about how they can update the content of their site after you have finished development.

While the specifics of your site will depend on your client's wishes, to ensure that you are completing a project that is sufficiently complex for a final assessment, you must have at least _three distinct page designs_ in your site.  That is, there must be at least three pages that differ from each other in some way other than just content.  This could mean moving elements around, adding additional elements (such as images, extra portions of text, etc.), or making other significant layout or design changes.


#### Grading
Your grade will consist of two parts for this project:

1.	After you have presented your final product to your client, he or she will evaluate the site as well as your communication and attentiveness to their requirements. (30 points)
2.	Mr. Wortzman will evaluate the technical details of the site, as well as checking your progress at the checkpoints and that your project has sufficiently rigorous requirements and expecations to be worthy of a final project. (30 points)  

See the rubric below for more details.
