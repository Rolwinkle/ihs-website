### Overview
In the early to mid-1990’s, when the public first gained access to the internet, the web was overrun with personal websites.  Many people’s first experience with web design was creating a site describing themselves and hosting it on services such as [Geocities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities) or [Angelfire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelfire).  In this project, you will use the simple tags you have learned so far to create a similar personal website telling visitors about yourself.  Note that you will not be able to change any design elements such as colors, fonts, or alignments.  That’s OK; we’ll learn how to do that later.

### Details

#### Design
You will create a simple website that tells visitors about yourself, your personal history, and your interests.  Your site should include **_at least_** the following information:

 * Your name, age, and grade
 * A brief personal biography (where you grew up, siblings, experiences, etc.)
 * Your school schedule for the current year, including details about each class
 * Descriptions of some of your interests and hobbies
 * A list of some of your favorite websites.

The information can be presented in any order and in any way you like, as long as it is all present.  You may also include additional information if you would like.  Feel free to be creative!

Whenever possible, you should provide links to related sites (such as the websites for your classes or your favorite sites) so that visitors can find more information.


#### Implementation Details
Your site must make use of the following HTML elements:

 * At least two headlines of different sizes
 * At least one external link and at least one local link
 * At least two images
 * At least one list
 * At least one table
 * 
Your site must consist of at least **three** different pages.  You may choose what information to put on each page, but you should make sure your site is well-organized and easy to navigate.  Think about how other sites you have visited are structured and try to use a similar model.

You must conform to all technical guidelines and standards we have discussed in class.  All your code **must validate**.  In addition, your code should be clean and easy to read, including proper nesting and indentation, good use of blank lines, and comments where appropriate.
