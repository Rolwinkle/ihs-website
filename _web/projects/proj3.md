### Overview
In today’s world, it is difficult for a business to succeed without some sort of web presence.  Customers are increasingly going to the web as their first source of information when looking for products or services, and a company that cannot be found on the internet will have a much harder time pulling in business.  For this assignment, you will create a website for a local business that wants to increase sales by drawing customers from online.

### Details

#### Design Requirements
You will be creating a website for “Granny’s Cookies,” a local small business owned by Granny herself (age 87).  Granny has several goals for her website:

* Attract new customers to her store
* Allow customers to learn about the different types of cookies she sells
* Promote new products that Granny has created
* Make it easy for new and current customers to find her store and know when it is open
* Advertise sales and special events
* Highlight Granny’s community connections

Your task will be to create a website that achieves all of the above goals, while effectively representing the personality of Granny’s Cookies.

Because her business is already established, Granny has certain branding requirements that you will need to meet.  She will be providing you with the following materials:

* A logo (in color)
* A biography of herself and history of her shop
* Photos and descriptions of some of her recipes
* A calendar of events and specials in her store

These materials can be downloaded here: **[Granny's Assets]({{site.baseurl}}\web\Granny's Assets.zip)**

You will need to use the materials Granny provides with **_minimal modification_**.  Some amount of change may be allowed with the permission of Granny’s business manager (Mr. Wortzman), but you will not be allowed to make major alterations.  You may develop any content Granny does not provide on your own, but remember to be consistent with the tone and personality of Granny’s business, and that you must maintain integrity at all times—**do not fabricate facts or pass off others’ recipes or photos as Granny’s**.

Lastly, Granny is not very tech-savvy, but she will need to update her site on occasion after you have completed it for her.  Therefore, you will need to design the site in a way that makes it easy for someone _who does not know HTML/CSS to make updates_.  In addition, you will be required to provide **written documentation** to Granny on how to make changes to her site.  This documentation will need to be clear and easy to understand, and may need to include screenshots or code snippets to illustrate.


#### Implementation Details
Your site will need to be attractive, easy to use, and well-organized.  You will also need to have a minimum of **five separate pages** on your site and intuitive ways to navigate among them.  Each page should have a distinct purpose and design, but should also clearly be part of the larger overall site.  Your site should also have a clear, attractive color scheme—use the tools we have discussed in class to help with this.  **You should not use any pre-existing imagery** other than the materials provided by Granny.  You may, however, create some of your own graphics if you would like.

You must conform to all technical guidelines and standards we have discussed in class.  You should organize the various files that make up your site into folders (main, styles, images) and all your code (both HTML and CSS) **must validate**.  In addition, your code should be clean and easy to read, including proper nesting and indentation, good use of blank lines, and comments where appropriate.
