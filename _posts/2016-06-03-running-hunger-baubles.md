If you'd like to work on your ship for The Hunger Baubles at home, here are the steps you'll need to follow:

1. Download the most recent release from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Mikeware/SpaceBattleArena/releases)
  * We will pretty much always be using the most recent release, whatever that is.
2. Make sure you are set up to run the client by following the [Client Setup Instructions](http://mikeware.github.io/SpaceBattleArena/client/jGRASP/index.html)
3. Follow the [Server Setup Instructions](http://mikeware.github.io/SpaceBattleArena/server/setup.html) to run a server on your machine.  We are currently using two config files in class: **machine_fullscreen1p5x.cfg** and **game_thehungerbaubles.cfg**.  Both are included in the server release.
  * There are minor tweaks being made to the game configuration (mostly around numbers of things), but nothing you should need to worry about.
