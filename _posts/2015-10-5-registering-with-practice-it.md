In order for me to be able to see and grade your assignments, including HW and projects, we need to do a bit of set up with the online systems we'll be using.  Please take the following steps:
- If you haven't already, fill out [this form](http://goo.gl/forms/uMRe7jWAag) and submit an e-mail address that you'd like to use when submitting assignments in this class.
- Visit [this secret page](http://practiceit.cs.washington.edu/courses.jsp) on Practice-It and connect to Issaquah High School, then to the 2015-2016 AP Comp. Sci. course.
Completing these steps will enable me to collect and grade assignments much faster, so please do this as soon as possible.
