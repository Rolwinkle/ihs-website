The [Space Battle](http://mikeware.github.io/SpaceBattleArena/) platform will be used for our final projects for this year.  If you want to work at home, follow the steps on the [Client Setup](http://mikeware.github.io/SpaceBattleArena/client/index.html) and [Server Setup](http://mikeware.github.io/SpaceBattleArena/server/setup.html) pages.  We will use some private releases of the platform for our activities, so please follow instructions provided in class and let us know if you're trying to work at home.
