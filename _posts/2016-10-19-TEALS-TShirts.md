title: TEALS T-Shirt Designs Due Friday 10/28
categories: [apcs]

TEALS K-12 wants to give each of my AP Computer Science students a free t-shirt! The only catch is that we have to create
the design for the front of the shirt. See the [Classroom T-Shirt Guidelines](http://www.tealsk12.org/partners/classroom-t-shirt-guidelines/) for details. Designs are due Friday 10/28/2016, and then we will vote to decide on the winner!
