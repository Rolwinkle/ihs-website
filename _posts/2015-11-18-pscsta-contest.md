The Puget Sound Computer Science Teachers Association is holding its annual Winter Programming Contest on Saturday, December 12.  This competition is a great chance to practice your programming skills, meet some really cool professional computer scientists, and win prizes!  More information on the contest is available on the [contest webpage](http://pscsta.org/pscsta-programming-contest/).  Lunch is provided for all participants, and there will be raffles as well!

Teams are 1-3 students, and must provide their own computer (one computer per team, no internet access allowed).  The contest runs with two divisions: Novice and Advanced.  If your team has _any_ member who has completed AP Computer Science (or a roughly equivalent programming course), you must enter the Advanced Division.  Most current AP students will enter the Novice Division.

Registration is open through Monday, November 23.  You can [register online](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1rXlmDWoWRvs0-GSRP9xR2O0EGJ4DFifRGQcjrUZs70U/viewform).  I will unfortunately not be able to attend the competition this year, but I am involved with the planning, so let me know if you have questions.  Good luck!
