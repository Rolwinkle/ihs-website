As part of their support of the computer science program at IHS, [TEALS](http://www.tealsk12.org) will be providing t-shirts to all students in Issaquah CS classes.  In order to receive your class t-shirt, please fill out the [T-Shirt Survey](http://goo.gl/forms/ZGx2qYs5R8) no later than **Wednesday, October 28**.

In addition, we are able to creat our own class t-shirt design.  If you are interested in submitting a possible design for a class t-shirt, please visit [www.uberprints.com](www.uberprints.com), create your design, and send a link to the finished template to Mr. Wortzman.  Your design must meet the following requirements:

* Designs must be one color only, and must only be on the front of the shirt.
* The design must include our school name (Issaquah High School) and "Computer Science" somewhere on the shirt.
* All elements of the design must be school-appropriate.

Please send you design to Mr. Wortzman by the start of school on **Wednesday, October 28**.  A favorite design will be chosen (either by Mr. Wortzman or by class vote) and submitted to TEALS by October 31.
